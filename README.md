# machine-learning

This is a machine learning framework built from scratch using [NumPy](https://numpy.org). It’s not meant for production use — this is more of a learning project to better understand the inner workings of AI and machine learning algorithms.

The framework includes:
	•	A modular neural network system with various layer types (inspired by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org))
	•	A flexible, node-based approach to decision trees
	•	A basic implementation of self-organizing maps (SOMs)

This is a hobbyist/academic project — expect clarity over optimization and curiosity over performance.
